# auto-ndjs-server 💻🚀


auto-ndjs-server npm package

Introduction:
The auto-ndjs-server library simplifies the process of setting up a Node.js server by handling the installation of the latest versions of key dependencies. These dependencies include:

🚀 express
🔄 cors
📦 body-parser
🔐 dotenv
Additionally, the library creates a basic server.js file, providing users with a convenient starting point for their Node.js applications.

Getting Started:
Install Node.js:
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from nodejs.org.

Install auto-ndjs-server:
Open your terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g auto-ndjs-server
This installs the library globally, making it accessible from anywhere in your terminal.

Initialize auto-ndjs-server:
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using the terminal.

bash
Copy code
mkdir my-node-app
cd my-node-app
Run the following command to set up your Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
auto-ndjs-server
This command installs all the dependencies with their latest versions and sets up a basic server.js file. The default port is 3000, but you can change it as needed.

Run the Server:
Start your Node.js server by running:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Your server will be accessible on the specified port.

Optional: Nodemon Setup:
For a more convenient development experience, consider using nodemon to automatically restart the server when files change.

Install Nodemon:
Install nodemon globally using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon
Configure package.json:
Add the following script to your package.json file:

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon server.js"
}
This enables you to run your server with nodemon using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Happy Coding! 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻
