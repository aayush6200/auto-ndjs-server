# 🌐 auto-ndjs-server npm package

## 📘 Introduction:
The **auto-ndjs-server** library 🛠️ streamlines the setup of a Node.js server by automating the installation of the latest versions of essential dependencies. These include:

- 🚀 express
- 🛡️ cors
- 📝 body-parser
- 🌐 dotenv

Additionally, it crafts a basic `server.js` file, giving users a helpful jumpstart for their Node.js projects.

## 🎬 Getting Started:

### 1. 📦 Install Node.js:
Ensure you have Node.js on your computer. If not, grab and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### 2. 💻 Install auto-ndjs-server:
- Open your terminal and execute the following command to install the library globally, allowing access from anywhere in your terminal.
  ```bash
  npm install -g auto-ndjs-server
  ```

### 3. 🏗️ Initialize auto-ndjs-server:
- Forge a new directory for your project and dive in using the terminal.
  ```bash
  mkdir my-node-app
  cd my-node-app
  ```
- Fire up your Node.js server with the next command. This will install all dependencies in their latest versions and create a basic `server.js` file. The default port is 3000, but feel free to adjust.
  ```bash
  auto-ndjs-server
  ```

### 4. 🚀 Run the Server:
- Kickstart your Node.js server by running:
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
  Your server is now live on the designated port!

## 🔁 Optional: Nodemon Setup:

For an enhanced development experience, use nodemon to auto-restart your server upon file changes.

### 🔄 Install Nodemon:
- Install nodemon globally with this command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g nodemon
  ```

### ⚙️ Configure package.json:
- Augment your `package.json` with this script to embrace nodemon:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
  }
  ```
  Now, ignite your server with nodemon using:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## 🎉 Happy Coding!
Embark on your development journey with **auto-ndjs-server** and simplify your Node.js server setup!
